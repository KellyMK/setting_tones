A--dorned with the **gar--ment of the priest--hood,
thou didst serve God like an an--gel, O Bas--il of **great re--nown,
**off--er--ing sac-- ri--fice to Him, Who appeared in the flesh for our sal--**va--tion.
There--fore thou was sa--cri--ficed like a **per--fect lamb,
be--com--ing a **pure off--er--ing.
Now thou has off--ered thy--self u--pon the al--tar of **heav--en.
There--fore, with our voi--ces we call thee **bless--ed
and in glad--ness and **joy we cry out to thee://
'Pray with--out ceas--ing that our **souls may be saved!




Thou wast flayed by a most un--right--eous judge, O **glor--ious one,
en--dur--ing bod--i--ly pains, and look--ing for--ward to a **pain--less end,
**and to the hon--ors pre--pared for those who **su--ffer.
Temp--ered like **steel in the fire,
thou didst be--come a well forged **sword of heav--en,
cutt--ing down the hosts of the e--ne--my, O **bless--ed one.
There--fore, ev--'ry na--tion of be--lie--vers re--joi--ces and hon--ors **thee to--day,//
O cour--a--geous-mind--ed ath--lete, tru--ly **glor--ious Ba--sil.
